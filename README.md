## Description

This is based on the tutorial from JSMastery which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M&t=12205s <br>
The code is slightly different as I used TypeScript instead of JavaScript <br>
Appwrite is used for the backend. <br>

The app won't function correctly immediately after cloning as secrets are held in a .env file and not in this repo. <br>

## How To Run

- Clone the repo
- Run npm install
- Configure .env file at the root of the project (Next to package.json)
- Run "npx expo start" in your terminal
- Install Expo go on your device
- Scan the QR code that should have been output in your terminal
